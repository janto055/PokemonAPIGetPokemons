# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: **Jaydon Antoine**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon API Get A Pokemon** is an android app that **the displays a scrollable list of the image, name, and weight of a random pokemon pulled from the PokeAPI.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶ãüíêüå∏**

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

This part of the project was straightforward! I learned how to define text color, size, and other text formatting via themes and styles. I did find it weird that attempting to set the fontFamily within the themes folder didn't work. I'll have to look further into why.

## Notes

Project 6 builds upon the previous project, where I built an app that made calls for random pokemon to the PokeApi. In Project 6, we made it so that the information we displayed in the previous project is now displayed in a Linear RecyclerView, meaning that we can now scroll through multiple results.

The most difficult thing about this project was, again, knowing how exactly to implement the API functionality. I still struggled to get the PokeApi to spit out sprite URLs in an easily accessible way so I opted to create a for loop that would run the random call multiple times. By doing this, I essentially created all the mutablelists needed to display images and text within the RecyclerView. 

Unfortunatly, this method has resulted in a bug where the RecycleView does not update with new information if the "Get Pokemons" button were to be tapped a second time. This bug persists even when attempts are made to clear the mutablelists before adding elements from the beginning of this list. This may be in relation to the way Recycler adds additional "pokemon_item" layouts to itself, which may alter the behavior of the "position" integer in the PokemonAdaptor. However, I would have to experiement further in order to confirm.

## AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Jaydon Antoine**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon API Get A Pokemon** is an android app that **the displays a random pokemon pulled from the PokeAPI. At the moment, it displays an image of the back of the character, its name, alongside its weight.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêâüê≥ü¶Ñ**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokeAPI**.

## Notes

Once again, this project proved to be a very valuable learning experience. In this case, it proved to be difficult to find an API that was easy to use within the AsyncHTTPClient framework provided. 
As a result, I ended up scratching my plans to build a music app, and stuck with one of the recommended APIs, in this case the PokeAPI. 

The main struggle I encountered was being able to parse through the JSON data, specifically for desplaying the image/sprite associated with the randomly chosen pokemon. For some reason, 
the JSON response was formatted in a way that made it very difficult to single out a specific image URL. After a few hours of trying, I ended up settling with just removing leading and trailing 
elements from the pokeImage string so that I would end up with the very first URL of the "sprites" JSON. Moving foward, I will look into better ways to get this feature to work, as I would love 
to have the front facing sprite be displayed instead.
